# Simple Neural Network

Very (very) simple neural networks based on [Neural Networks Clearly Explained](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLblh5JKOoLUIxGDQs4LFFD--41Vzf-ME1)
- `01_SimpleOne.ipynb` is a one-layer, one-neuron one
- `02_TwoNeurons.ipynb` is a one-layer, two-neuron one

The output of each one is series of images, so I can make animations with them.
