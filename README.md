# Simple Neural Network

Very (very) simple neural networks based on [Neural Networks Clearly Explained](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLblh5JKOoLUIxGDQs4LFFD--41Vzf-ME1)
- `01_OneNeuronWithHidden.ipynb` is a one-layer, one-neuron with hidden layer
- `02_02_TwoNeuronsWithHidden.ipynb` is a one-layer, two-neuron with hidden layer

The output of each one is series of images, so I can make animations with them.
